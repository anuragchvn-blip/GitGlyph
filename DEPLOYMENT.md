## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Start dev server
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run lint               # Run linting

# Deployment
vercel --prod              # Deploy to production
vercel logs               # View deployment logs
vercel env add            # Add environment variable
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Insufficient funds" error**
   - Ensure Bundlr wallet has MATIC balance
   - Check Polygon network connectivity

2. **Contract interaction fails**
   - Verify contract address in environment
   - Check user's wallet is on Polygon network
   - Ensure contract is verified on Polygonscan

3. **Gist not found**
   - Verify gist is public
   - Check GitHub API rate limits
   - Validate gist URL format

4. **Build errors**
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check Next.js compatibility
